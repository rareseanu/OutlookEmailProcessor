# Outlook email processor add-in
This add-in allows the user to extract specific fields from an email based on configurable JSON templates. Furthermore, URL's in the shape of an action specific to the configured templates can also be extracted, thus enabling the user to send a chain of HTTP requests related to the starting URL found in the email body.

# Configuration
The main file used for configuration is `patterns.json`, located in `src/taskpane`. This JSON file is structured as follows:
```json
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "Test pattern {email}": {
                "description": "Test description.",
                "actions": [
                    {
                        "Test action - {url}": {
                            "requests": [
                                {
                                    "url": "https://localhost:3000/firstRequest.html",
                                    "type": "GET"
                                },
                                {
                                    "url": "https://localhost:3000/secondRequest.html",
                                    "type": "PUT",
                                    "params": [
                                        "name=test"
                                    ]
                                },
                                {
                                    "url": "https://localhost:3000/thirdRequest.html",
                                    "type": "POST",
                                    "params": [
                                        "request2param=name",
                                        "email={email}"
                                    ]
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
            "Second pattern {user}": {
                "description": "Pattern without any actions defined."
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
The params array from each request also allows for 2 special string literals: `requestREQ_NOparam=PARAM_NAME`, `requestREQ_NObody=PARAM_NAME` (where REQ_NO is the index of the request we want to take information from, "param" and "body" are the locations where we want to look for data, request's used parameters & JSON body response) and `param={FIELD_NAME}` ({FIELD_NAME} will be replaced with the value extracted from the email subject/body).

Based on the JSON structure example given previously, the workflow is as follows:

* We loop through each pattern defined in the JSON file, match the subject/body with the pattern's key: "Test pattern {email}" and extract special fields defined between curly brackets.
* We match the action key, "Test action - {url}" and extract its starting URL. After that we send the initial HTTP request, process the next request (special params that are based on the previously executed requests or on extracted fields) defined in this action and send it. Requests are being sent sequentially until there's none left in the request chain.
* In the third request, `request2param=name` will look for the `name` param inside the second request and will be replaced by its name and value pair. `email={email}` will replace the special field {email} with the value extracted from the initial email pattern.

Depending on the user's needs, special fields can also be added/modified:

* Declare regex literal \for that specific field inside `src/taskpane/taskpane.js`.
* Add it to the `regexMap` dictionary, inside `src/taskpane/taskpane.js` line 48.
* Add the field to the replace function, inside `src/taskpane/taskpane.js` line 74.


# TODO:
* Add field in the config file that identifies functions that need to be executed on action match.
* Error handling for the config file content.
* Logic behind the excel action.
* Benchmark regexes inside the simulator.
